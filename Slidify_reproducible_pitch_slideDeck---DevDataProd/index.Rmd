## World Landmass Area Guessing Game (WLAGG)

#### A project created for the Coursera Developing Data Products course.

--- .class #id 

## Want to test your knowledge of geography?

#### Play WLAGG!

#### This game offers you the opportunity to guess the area of 48 different world landmasses.

---
## WLAGG is a Shiny app powered by R!

#### Here's a peek at 5 of the landmasses that you'll get to experience (and the programming language behind the fun):

```{r islands}
data(islands)
random_indices <- sample(1:48, 5, replace = FALSE)
for (i in random_indices) {
  cat(names(islands[i]), "\n")
}
```

#### Wow!

---

## WLAGG has a simple user interface.
